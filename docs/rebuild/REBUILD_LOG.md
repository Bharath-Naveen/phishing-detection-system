# Rebuild log

What was changed, why, and what it did to the numbers. Newest entries at the bottom. For how the system works as a whole, see [HOW_IT_WORKS.md](HOW_IT_WORKS.md). The plan these steps follow lives in the claude.ai project (`claude/rebuild-plan.md`).

Branch: `rebuild/verified-metrics`. Nothing here is on `main` until the pull request is merged.

## 2026-09-29 · Phase 0: Git cleanup and the "before" snapshot

**Why.** Your laptop copy and GitHub had each gained one commit the other did not have (BUILD_STORY.md locally, a README line on GitHub). And on Windows, almost every file showed as "modified" only because of line endings.

**What was done.**
- Started the branch from GitHub's `main` and replayed your BUILD_STORY.md commit on top, so both commits are kept.
- `ce9a78b` Repo hygiene: added `.gitattributes` so Git stores line endings consistently (the "every file modified" noise goes away). Started tracking `data/reference/*.csv`: two tiny public domain lists the app and 6 tests need; a fresh clone failed without them.
- `0ea50d9` Added the audit (`metrics/`) exactly as it was run, as the "before" picture. Tagged `audit-baseline-2026-09-29`.

**What it means for you.** Any later number can be compared against this tag.

## 2026-09-29 · Phase 1: Correctness fixes

Each fix below says what was wrong, how it works now, and where the code is. All 266 tests pass (253 original + 13 new). On a fresh clone with no trained models: 263 pass, 3 skip (model smoke tests), 0 fail; before this phase a fresh clone had 6 failures.

### 1. One way to read a URL (the root cause of the leak and the skew)

**Was wrong.** The Kaggle file mixes `https://x.com/a` with bare `x.com/a`. One training path (`retrain_with_fresh.py`, which produced the currently shipped models) passed bare hosts straight into feature extraction. Python's URL parser then saw *no hostname*, so hostname length, dot count, entropy and so on were all zero for 75% of rows. At runtime the app adds `http://` first, so the same URL produced different features in production than in training.

**Now.** `src/pipeline/url_normalize.py` is the single place that decides what a URL is. `extract_layer1_features()` normalizes its input itself, so it no longer matters who calls it or in what form. `retrain_with_fresh.py` canonicalizes instead of copying raw strings. Canonical form also treats `x.com` and `x.com/` as the same address.

### 2. The split really groups by website now

**Was wrong.** Grouping used the registered domain, but for bare hosts the parser failed and every row got its own random `malformed::` group. So 55% of the shipped models' "held-out" test rows were on websites also in training.

**Now.** `leak_safe_group_key()` canonicalizes before extracting the domain. Two **guards** (`src/pipeline/guards.py`) stop the pipeline with a plain message if more than 0.5% of rows lack a real domain, or if any domain is in both train and test. In the Phase 1 check run: 63 of 47,852 rows (0.13%) lacked a domain, 0 domains overlapped.

### 3. A train/serve parity check

**Now.** Before training, 300 stored training rows have their features recomputed exactly as the app would. Any difference stops the run. Phase 1 check: 300 checked, 0 mismatched. A unit test also checks that `x.com`, `http://x.com/`, `HTTPS://X.com` all produce identical model features.

### 4. Evaluation URLs stay out of training

**Was wrong.** The curated test URLs (for example google.com, wikipedia.org, the 15 "hard legit" URLs, and the 8 URLs the old model-selection rule scored) were being added to the training data. So some "tests" were questions the model had already seen the answers to.

**Now.** `drop_evaluation_rows()` (`src/pipeline/evaluation_sets.py`) removes every training row on the domain of a legitimate evaluation URL, or on the exact host of a phishing evaluation URL (host, not domain, because many phishing URLs live on shared hosts like github.io; dropping all of github.io would remove thousands of useful rows). The hard-legit list is no longer added to training at all. Two new evaluation files were created from your existing data: 298 official brand URLs (split by domain into a validation half and a test half) and 284 PhishStats phishing URLs. Phase 1 check: from the 50K sample, 3,017 rows on legitimate-evaluation domains and 13 rows on phishing-evaluation hosts were removed.

### 5. The model can no longer see http vs https

**Was wrong.** In this dataset, an explicit `https://` is far more common on phishing rows than legit ones (on the real web, nearly everything is https). The old code dropped the `has_https` column but kept two columns built from it, plus `url_length`, which is longer by one character for https.

**Now.** Features are computed on a copy of the URL with the scheme forced to `http://`, and all three scheme-derived columns are excluded from training. `has_https` still reports the real scheme for the dashboard. Model features: 56 before, 54 now.

### 6. Model and calibrator travel together (the "bundle")

**Was wrong.** Deploying a new model copied only the model file. The probability calibrator on disk was fit for an older, different model, so it made the shipped model's probabilities slightly worse, not better (Brier 0.1149 raw vs 0.1168 "calibrated").

**Now.** Training writes `layer1_bundle.joblib`: the model, its own calibrator, the exact feature list, and provenance (train-data hash, row counts, seed, date, selection rule). The app loads the bundle first and only falls back to the old loose files if no bundle exists. Deploying copies the bundle, and removes a stale one if the new run has none.

### 7. A model-selection rule that uses validation data

**Was wrong.** The "composite" rule scored each model as F1 minus its average phishing probability on 8 famous websites. Those 8 URLs were in the training data, and the rule picked Logistic Regression (the weakest model) every time.

**Now.** The default rule is `validated`: best PR-AUC on a validation set that is split off the training rows by domain, ties broken by fewer false alarms on the validation half of the official-brand URLs. The test set is never used to choose. Also fixed: the validation split used to be a random row split (so the calibrator saw the same websites it was trained on); it is now grouped by domain. The old rules are still available as options. Phase 1 check picked LightGBM.

### 8. Tests no longer touch your real files

**Was wrong.** Running `pytest` wrote reports into `outputs/reports/` and CSVs into `data/processed/` (your `split_leak_safe_stats.json` there was test output).

**Now.** `tests/conftest.py` points every test run at a temporary folder and copies the shipped models there so the model tests still run.

### 9. Obvious phishing no longer comes back as "uncertain"

**Was wrong.** `google-login-secure.xyz/signin` and `totally-fake-bank-login.xyz/verify` had raw ML scores of about 0.97, but without live capture the EAL returned `uncertain`. The host checker only looked for brand names in *subdomains*, so a brand inside the registered name itself (`google-login-secure`) passed as an ordinary host.

**Now.** `host_path_reasoning.py` also checks the registered name: a brand token used as a prefix or glued to other text on a non-official domain, or two or more credential-lure words (login, verify, bank, secure, account, ...) in the name. Either marks the host as a suspicious pattern, and the existing EAL rule then convicts when ML is very confident. How often the new rule fires on a 40,000-row Kaggle sample: 190 phishing vs 36 legit rows (about 84% phishing); 0 of 298 official brand URLs; 1 of 884 curated homepages. It only changes a verdict when the ML score is also high. Two regression tests pin this.

### Phase 1 check: what the numbers look like now

Command: `python metrics/scripts/10_phase1_check.py` (50K sample, seed 42, 73 s). Result file: `metrics/results/10_phase1_check.json`.

| | Audit baseline (before) | After Phase 1 |
|---|---|---|
| Rows in the 50K run after exclusions | 50,896 | 47,852 |
| Model features | 56 | 54 |
| Selected primary model | Logistic Regression (composite rule) | LightGBM (validated rule) |
| LightGBM test F1 / ROC-AUC | 0.860 / 0.944 | 0.823 / 0.908 |
| LightGBM test precision / recall | 0.910 / 0.815 | 0.805 / 0.842 |
| Layer 1 false alarms on official brand URLs (test half) | not measured this way | 33.8% (46 of 136) |
| Dashboard verdicts on those URLs (ML-only) | all `uncertain` | all `uncertain` (0 `likely_phishing`) |
| Layer 1 recall on 284 PhishStats phishing URLs | n/a for this run | 79.6% |
| URL suites, dashboard ML-only | obvious phish 1/2, hard phish 3/4 | obvious phish 2/2, hard phish 4/4 |

**Why the scores went down, and why that is good.** The before and after test sets are not identical (the evaluation domains were removed), and three shortcuts the model used to rely on are gone: the http/https artifact, easy evaluation domains in training, and a validation set that shared websites with training. The new numbers are what the model can actually do on websites it has never seen. The audit's scheme-only ablation predicted about 2 F1 points from the scheme fix alone; the rest comes from the harder, cleaner test set and grouped validation.

**What is still weak (for later phases).** URL-only models still flag about a third of real official brand URLs; the EAL keeps them at `uncertain`, so no false phishing verdict reaches the user, but the ML layer needs better legitimate training data (Tranco top sites were planned). That is a Phase 3 data task.

### Still open after Phase 1
- The shipped models in `outputs/models/` are the old, flawed ones. They get replaced after the full retrain in Phase 3.
- The `metrics/` audit scripts describe the *old* pipeline on purpose (they are the "before" record). Phase 3 replaces them with one evaluation command for the new code.
- Live-capture measurements wait for GitHub Actions (Phase 4).

---

## 2026-09-30 · Phase 2: Restructure (same behavior, clearer code)

**Goal.** Make the code easy to find your way around and easy to explain, without changing a single verdict. Current layout and a code map: [HOW_IT_WORKS.md](HOW_IT_WORKS.md), Part 5.

### Step 1: A safety net first (golden-output tests)

**What.** Before moving anything, the full dashboard output was frozen for 103 cases: 95 URLs through the ML-only path (the suites, hard-legit list, official brand and PhishStats samples, and tricky shapes like punycode, IP hosts, user-hosted clones) and 8 hand-built live-capture cases (legit same-domain login, credential form posting to another domain, wrapper page, blocked capture, news article, free-hosted brand clone, security block page, official authwall). The ML scores are recorded once and replayed, so the test protects the rules and the adjudication logic, not whichever model is on disk.

**Proof it works.** Nudging one verdict threshold from 0.56 to 0.57 made 52 of the 104 golden checks fail. So "all golden tests pass" really does mean "same outputs".

**It already caught a bug.** The trusted-domain registry cache ignored which file it was loaded from, so whichever test loaded it first decided what every later lookup saw. The golden test failed only when run after certain other tests. The cache is now keyed by file path (the platform registry already had this fix).

### Step 2: Archive what nothing uses

An import-graph scan found 19 modules that nothing in the app, the training pipelines or the audits reaches. They moved to `archive/legacy/` with a README each:
- `ai_adjudication/`: the retired OpenAI adjudication path and the old screenshot/compare triage flow built around it (9 app modules, 2 pipeline modules, their tests).
- `old_pipeline/`: 8 superseded pipeline scripts (old ingest, the non-grouped split, run_all, and so on).

`openai` was removed from `requirements.txt` since no running code imports it.

### Step 3: Move everything into one package

`src/pipeline/` and `src/app_v1/` became `src/phishguard/` with sub-packages by job: `urls`, `data`, `features`, `models`, `pipelines`, `evaluation`, `app`. Done with `git mv` (history kept) plus an automatic import rewrite. A few files got clearer names, for example `analyze_dashboard.py` is now `app/dashboard.py`, `run_kaggle_pipeline.py` is `pipelines/kaggle.py`, `split_leak_safe.py` is `data/split.py`. Imports are now `phishguard.*`, with `src/` on the path.

### Step 4: Split the 3,585-line dashboard file

It is now seven files, each with one job: `dashboard.py` (wires the layers together, 594 lines), `eal.py` (the judge), `verdict_rules.py` (adjustments before the judge), `capture_signals.py`, `registries.py`, `brand_coherence.py`, `domain_utils.py`. Function bodies were moved by a script, not retyped, and `dashboard.py` re-exports the moved names so old imports still work. Golden tests: identical.

While checking for undefined names, a latent bug surfaced: the full (non-Layer-1) enrich path in `data/enrich.py` called `safe_hostname` without importing it, so it would have crashed the first time anyone used it. Fixed.

### Step 5: One command, one config

- `phishguard train | analyze | evaluate | deploy | serve` (install with `pip install -e .`; `python -m phishguard` also works).
- `phishguard/config.py` holds the seed (42) and defaults.
- Docker: `PYTHONPATH=/app/src`, new frontend path, and the image now includes the small registries the app needs (`data/official_domains.json`, `data/reference/`, `data/evaluation/`). A plain `docker build` used to leave them out, so a hosted container would have run without them. Not built here because this workspace has no Docker daemon; GitHub Actions builds it in Phase 4.
- README (setup, commands, layout) and docs updated to the new paths.

### Gate 2 result

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| Full test suite | 362 passed (359 carried over + 3 new CLI tests; 11 AI-only tests moved to the archive with their code) |
| Golden outputs (103 cases) | identical before and after every step |
| Undefined names (ruff F821) in `src/phishguard` | 0 |

### Still open after Phase 2
- `phishguard evaluate` currently runs the URL-suite benchmark only; Phase 3 turns it into the single reproducible evaluation command.
- The `metrics/` audit scripts now import the new package, so running them on this branch measures the new code. The "before" numbers stay pinned to tag `audit-baseline-2026-09-29`.

## 2026-09-30 · Phase 3: Retrain and evaluate

### Pre-registered decision: Tranco legitimate homepages (written before seeing any result)

The URL model flags about a third of real official brand URLs as phishing, because the Kaggle legitimate rows look little like modern official sites. One candidate fix is to add homepages of popular real domains from a pinned Tranco list (list `K9QPW`, generated 2026-09-01, sha256 `611a342b...`) as extra legitimate training rows.

To avoid picking whichever version happens to look best on the test set, the rule is fixed now, before either run is evaluated:

- Train two full runs with identical settings (seed 42): **A** Kaggle only, **B** Kaggle plus the top **20,000** Tranco homepages.
- Compare them on **validation data only** (never the test set, never PhishStats):
  1. false-alarm rate of the selected model on the **validation half** of the official brand URLs, and
  2. PR-AUC on the **Kaggle-origin rows** of the domain-grouped validation split.
- **Adopt B only if** it lowers (1) by at least **5 percentage points** and does not lower (2) by more than **0.01**. Otherwise keep A.
- Whichever wins is then evaluated once with `phishguard evaluate`. Both runs' validation numbers are reported here either way.

### Tranco experiment result (decided by the rule above)

| Run | Selected model | Official-brand validation false-alarm rate | Validation PR-AUC (Kaggle rows) |
|---|---|---|---|
| A: Kaggle only | XGBoost | 37.0% | 0.939 |
| B: + 19,899 Tranco homepages | Random Forest | 40.1% | 0.858 |

B made both criteria worse (false alarms up 3.1 points instead of down 5; PR-AUC down 0.081 instead of within 0.01), so **A is kept** and Tranco stays off by default. Likely reason: in this dataset about half the phishing rows are also bare hostnames, so thousands of "short homepage = legitimate" examples pull real phishing homepages toward legitimate. The option remains available (`phishguard train --extra-legit-tranco N`) for future experiments.

### What was built

- **`phishguard evaluate`** (`evaluation/evaluate.py`, `evaluation/report.py`): one command that reads a finished run and measures everything: held-out metrics for all four models plus a majority-class baseline with 1,000-sample bootstrap 95% CIs, the selected model at the app's own threshold, grouped 5-fold CV, the external sets (official brand test half, PhishStats), the real dashboard's verdicts on those sets, latency, and the test suite with coverage. It writes `metrics/results/evaluation.json` and renders `metrics/VERIFIED_METRICS.md` and `docs/MODEL_CARD.md` from it, so no number is typed by hand.
- **`metrics/reproduce.sh`** is now two commands: `phishguard train --full`, then `phishguard evaluate --with-tests`. Measured: 1,316 seconds on 2 CPU cores.
- **The full run no longer takes hours.** Layer-1 enrichment rewrote its whole checkpoint file every 400 rows; it now checkpoints every 50,000. Full training takes about 12 minutes.
- **Run manifests for full runs.** The pipeline only recorded run mode and augmentation counts for sampled runs; it now always does.
- The pre-rebuild audit moved to `metrics/audit_baseline/` with a README.

### Final numbers (full run, commit `be39bd1`)

All in `metrics/VERIFIED_METRICS.md`. Highlights: XGBoost held-out F1 0.801 (95% CI 0.799 to 0.803), ROC-AUC 0.880, on 147,702 URLs from unseen domains; grouped CV F1 0.828 ± 0.015; 365/365 tests pass.

**Reproducibility check.** The final run was trained twice from scratch (once during development, once through `reproduce.sh` at a clean commit). Every held-out metric matched to the last digit.

### Things the numbers taught us (honest notes)

- **Lower than the 50K check, and that is expected.** The Phase 1 check (50K sample) gave F1 0.823 / ROC-AUC 0.908; the full run gives 0.801 / 0.880. The full test set is 16 times larger, and the 46,712 rows on the 38 evaluation domains (mostly famous sites like google.com and microsoft.com, which are easy legitimate examples) are removed. Grouped CV on 100,000 rows gives ROC-AUC 0.908 ± 0.016, so this single held-out split sits about 1.7 standard deviations below the CV mean (within normal split-to-split variation for grouped data).
- **XGBoost was selected even though LightGBM has a slightly higher test F1** (0.803 vs 0.801). Selection looks only at validation data (XGBoost had the best validation PR-AUC, 0.938). Picking by test F1 would be using the test set to choose, which is the mistake this rebuild removed.
- **Calibration currently hurts slightly.** The isotonic calibrator makes the test Brier score a bit worse (0.1408 raw vs 0.1455 calibrated). Open item: decide on validation data whether to keep it.
- **The URL model alone is weak on famous sites.** Because every evaluation domain is removed from training, the model never sees google.com or amazon.com as legitimate, and Layer 1 flags them. The adjudication layer (which also has the official-domain registry) keeps them out of phishing verdicts. The in-browser demo (Phase 6) must show both layers, not the URL score alone.
- **Without live capture, the dashboard is cautious**: it detects 24.3% of PhishStats URLs as `likely_phishing` and sends the rest to `uncertain`, with 0 false phishing verdicts on official brand URLs. Live capture (Phase 4) is what can move `uncertain` cases either way.

---

## 2026-09-30 · Phase 4: CI and live-capture evaluation

**Goal.** Measure what could not be measured in a sandbox without internet: the full system with real page capture, the legitimacy-rescue layer's effect, full-path latency and the live edge-case suite. And get a CI badge that proves the tests pass on every push.

### What was built

- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** runs on every push and pull request:
  - installs the project and runs the full test suite with coverage (golden-output and pipeline-guard tests included);
  - smoke-tests the `phishguard analyze` command with the shipped model;
  - builds the Docker image and runs one analysis inside it (the image could not be built in the earlier sandbox).
- **`phishguard evaluate-live`** (`evaluation/live.py`) captures each page **once** with Playwright, then runs the full analysis **twice** on that capture, with the legitimacy-rescue layer on and off. Same pages, same moment, so the difference is only the rescue layer. URL sets: the 15 live edge cases (now in `data/evaluation/eal_edge_cases.json` with their expected outcomes), the 18 suite URLs, 15 hard-legit URLs, the 136 official brand test-half URLs, the newest PhishStats phishing URLs at run time, and a seeded sample of popular legitimate homepages. It reports pass rates, capture-failure rates (phishing pages are often taken down within hours), the rescue on/off difference and full-path latency, then adds a live-capture section to `metrics/VERIFIED_METRICS.md`.
- **`.github/workflows/live-capture.yml`** runs that evaluation on a GitHub runner. It runs when started by hand from the Actions tab (with options), and once automatically when the evaluator itself changes on this branch; that run commits its results back so they can be reviewed. It is deliberately not on a timer (next point).
- **The verified model now ships in the repo** (`models/layer1/`, 14.6 MB, with `MANIFEST.json`: file hashes, training commit, training-data hash). The app loads `outputs/models/` if you trained your own and otherwise uses the shipped model, so a fresh clone, CI and the Docker image all run the evaluated model. The Random Forest file was re-saved compressed to fit GitHub's size limits (same fitted object).

### Found along the way

- **Capture types a dummy login.** On any page with a username and password field, capture fills `test.user@example.com` / a fake password and submits once, to see where credentials go. That is useful on phishing pages but it also sends failed logins to real sites (LinkedIn, PayPal, bank logins in the evaluation sets). Kept as the default (it is how the system was designed and measured), but there is now a switch, `PHISH_ENABLE_LOGIN_INTERACTION=false`, and the live workflow has a matching option. This is also why the live evaluation does not run on a schedule.
- **Capture folder name.** The Phase 2 import rewrite turned the capture output folder `captures/app_v1` into `captures/phishguard.app`. Now `captures/app`.
- **A failed capture can push toward phishing.** In a smoke test where the browser could not start, even `example.com` came out `likely_phishing`, because the system treats "could not see the page" plus a high URL score as suspicious. The live run reports pass rates both overall and for successfully captured pages only, so this effect is visible rather than hidden.

### First live run (GitHub Actions run 36749733710, commit `2b90195`)

244 URLs, each captured once and analyzed twice. Full table in `metrics/VERIFIED_METRICS.md`; raw rows in `metrics/results/live_capture.json`.

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| Official brand URLs (test half) | 134 of 136 captured; 102 `likely_legitimate`, 26 `uncertain`, **8 `likely_phishing` (5.9%)** |
| Live edge cases | 13 of 15 pass |
| Curated suites | 17 of 18 pass |
| Full-path latency (capture + analysis) | p50 7.1 s, p95 16.1 s |
| Legitimacy rescue on vs off | fired on 86 URLs, **changed 0 final verdicts** |
| Fresh phishing URLs | **none tested**: the PhishStats API returned nothing from the GitHub runner |

What it taught us (each is a real finding, not a tuning target yet):

1. **The rescue layer adjusts scores but never changes a verdict.** It fired on 86 of 244 pages and the final verdict was identical every time, because the Evidence Adjudication Layer decides afterwards. So "the rescue layer reduces false positives" cannot be claimed. It is a candidate for simplification.
2. **Legitimate login flows trip two hard blockers.** Of 14 false phishing verdicts on successfully captured legitimate pages, 9 came from `wrapper_or_interstitial_redirect_pattern` (Wells Fargo, Chase, Outlook, OneDrive sign-in redirects, plus news sites with consent walls) and 4 from `credential_harvesting_pattern` (Dropbox login, AWS console, Stripe dashboard login). These rules treat normal single-sign-on redirects and login forms as abuse.
3. **A failed capture almost always becomes `likely_phishing`.** 19 of 20 legitimate URLs whose capture failed were labeled phishing, mostly infrastructure domains from the Tranco sample that have no website (DNS does not resolve) plus two sites that block headless browsers. "Could not see the page" plus a high URL score is treated as suspicious. That is defensible for unknown domains, but the label claims more certainty than the evidence gives.
4. **Two Weebly phishing edge cases now come back `uncertain`.** The pages were captured, so either the pages changed since April or the rules drifted; it needs a look.

Fixes made after this run:
- **Fresh phishing URLs now have a fallback.** If PhishStats returns nothing, the evaluator uses the OpenPhish public feed and records which source was used.
- **The popular-homepage sample skips domains that do not resolve** (infrastructure domains with no website) and reports how many were skipped, so the set measures real websites.
- Pushing these changes re-runs the live workflow automatically.

Not fixed on purpose: findings 1 to 3 are changes to the adjudication rules. Tuning them while looking at the official-brand **test** half would be tuning on the test set. The honest way is to tune on the **validation** half and confirm once on the test half; that is proposed as the next step.

### Second live run (GitHub Actions run 36758082929, commit `0014d21`)

304 URLs. This time the phishing feed worked (PhishStats answered; the OpenPhish fallback was not needed) and 17 popular-list domains with no website were skipped.

| What | Run 1 | Run 2 |
|---|---|---|
| Official brand URLs (test half), `likely_phishing` | 8 of 136 | 8 of 136 (same 8 pages) |
| All legitimate URLs, `likely_phishing` | 33 of 233 | 25 of 233 |
| of which: capture failed | 19 | 8 |
| of which: wrapper/interstitial blocker | 9 | 10 |
| of which: credential-harvesting blocker | 4 | 4 |
| Popular homepages (Tranco) pass rate | 63.3% | 76.7% (86.8% when the page loaded) |
| Fresh phishing URLs called `likely_phishing` | not tested | **22 of 60 (36.7%)** |
| Fresh phishing URLs called `likely_legitimate` | not tested | **25 of 60** |
| Rescue layer changed a verdict | 0 of 244 | 0 of 304 |
| Full-path latency p50 / p95 | 7.1 s / 16.1 s | 6.8 s / 15.0 s |
| Live edge cases | 13 of 15 | 13 of 15 (same two Weebly pages `uncertain`) |

The new and most important finding is **recall on fresh phishing is low**. The URL model alone put 44 of the 60 above 0.5, but the full system called only 22 phishing and called 25 legitimate. So on this sample the page-level rules lower recall rather than raise it. Looking at the 25:

- 7 had a URL score of 0.8 or higher and were still called legitimate (for example pages on godaddysites.com, square.site, ukit.me, edgeone.dev). These are site-builder pages where the capture did not show a login form, and the rules read "clean page on a known platform" as safe.
- About 10 are the same kit (`/?email=a@a.com&uid=...` and `/point/download/` on random domains). They almost certainly show a harmless page to a data-center browser (cloaking), so the capture never sees the phishing content.
- A few feed entries are not phishing pages at all by the time of capture: real login or captcha pages the phish redirected to (yandex.ru captcha, id.superhuman.com, login.account.rakuten.com, att.com). Feed labels are "reported as phishing", not ground truth.

What this means for claims: the full system's value today is **low false alarms on real brand sites** (8 of 136 flagged), not catching fresh phishing. "Catches X% of live phishing" cannot be claimed. Any tuning must be judged on both sides at once: fewer false alarms on legitimate login pages *and* no further loss of fresh-phishing recall.
## 2026-09-30 · Phase 4b: rule tuning, step 1 (plan and frozen data)

- **The tuning rules were written down before any tuning**: `docs/rebuild/TUNING_PLAN.md` fixes the data, the label hygiene, what code may change (rules only; no allowlisting evaluation sites, no model changes), the keep/reject rule, and that the test split is scored once.
- **Frozen snapshot tooling.** `phishguard snapshot-live` (workflow `live-snapshot.yml`) captures every evaluation URL once and commits the capture records plus page HTML as one gzipped file. `phishguard replay --split val|test|all` runs the full analysis on those saved captures with no network, so before/after numbers compare the same pages. Every test-split replay is logged to `metrics/results/test_access_log.jsonl`.
- **One amendment made before any capture**: a dry run of URL selection showed that grouping fresh phishing by registered domain would collapse every godaddysites.com / sharepoint.com page into one, so grouping and the "popular site" exclusion use the host instead. Recorded in the plan.
- Tests: 370 pass (new `tests/test_snapshot.py` freezes two fake captures and checks two replays give identical verdicts).

## 2026-09-30 · Phase 4b: rule tuning, step 2 (results)

**Frozen snapshot** (GitHub Actions run 36772263380, commit `4b856de`): 746 URLs captured once, 713 captured cleanly, saved as `data/evaluation/frozen/live_snapshot_20260930.jsonl.gz` (41.5 MB, sha256 `517d4560b4c3...`). Fresh phishing came from PhishStats (960 rows fetched, 240 hosts kept).

**What changed** (`app/eal.py`, one new idea used in two places): a *coherent first-party page* is one where the title or header names the site's own domain, the visit stayed on that registered domain, the transport is valid HTTPS, and nothing posts or leaks off-site. When another brand is mentioned on the page (Apple Pay on a bank page) that is tolerated only if no brand sits in the host or path and the host does not carry a big-brand name unless it is that brand's official domain.

1. A password form with an empty action (how most modern sites submit, via JavaScript) is no longer a hard "credential harvesting" blocker on a coherent first-party page. Sparse brand-login clones and forms that post to another domain are still hard blockers.
2. The wrapper/interstitial blocker skips coherent first-party pages too (sign-in redirects inside Google, Bank of America and similar).

**Result** (replaying the same saved pages; shipped model; `metrics/results/tuning/`):

| Split | Rules | Legit pages labeled phishing | of which official brand | Fresh phishing caught | Fresh phishing called legitimate |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| val | before | 41 / 273 | 19 / 162 | 25 / 109 | 41 / 109 |
| val | after | 28 / 273 | 11 / 162 | 25 / 109 | 41 / 109 |
| test | before | 22 / 212 | 7 / 136 | 39 / 99 | 40 / 99 |
| test | after | 19 / 212 | 4 / 136 | 39 / 99 | 40 / 99 |

On test exactly three pages changed, all legitimate sign-in pages (Dropbox login, Dropbox home, Chase auth), and no phishing page changed. The 103 golden dashboard cases did not change.

**What did not work, and why it was not forced:**
- *Catching more fresh phishing.* The URL model gives 0.99 to plain homepages like tesla.com and webex.com, so "high URL score plus a clean-looking page" catches as many legitimate sites as phishing ones (at 0.95 on val: 46 phishing, 31 legitimate). Turning that into a phishing verdict would add false alarms, which the plan forbids. Recall stays low (23% val, 39% test); the model is the lever, not the rules.
- *Failed captures.* Legitimate and phishing pages that fail to load carry identical evidence (high URL score, nothing to look at). Recall excludes failed captures, so relaxing them would have looked free on paper while missing real phishing. Left unchanged.
- *A "victim email in the URL" rule* (for example `?email=a@a.com`) looked useful at first but added nothing once scored with the correct model; the plan's tie rule keeps the smaller change, so it was removed.

**A mistake caught along the way (and fixed):** the cloud workspace had an `outputs/models` folder with the pre-rebuild model (left over from an older copy of the repo, dated 29 September). The app used any `outputs/models` folder in preference to the verified model in `models/layer1`, so the first tuning pass and one test-split run scored URLs with the stale model while GitHub Actions used the right one. Found because a before/after comparison changed pages the new rules could not touch. Fixes: the loader now ignores a folder without a model bundle (with a warning, test added), every report records which model file was loaded and its hash, the tuning was redone with the correct model, and the bad test run is kept in `metrics/results/test_access_log.jsonl` marked invalid. To check whether the Phase 3 "dashboard ML-only" numbers had the same problem, the full reproduce script was run again (`metrics/reproduce.sh`): those rows came out identical, so Phase 3 had the right model (the stale folder arrived later, when this workspace was restored). XGBoost, LightGBM and Random Forest reproduced exactly; the freshly trained bundle gives the same probabilities as the shipped one (max difference 0.0 on 5,000 test rows). Logistic regression, one of the four supporting models, moved slightly (8 of 147,702 test predictions; F1 0.7347 to 0.7346), so its numbers are reproducible to about three decimals rather than exactly. The test rows were seen once in that bad run; nothing from them was used to choose rules (the final rules are a subset of what was chosen on val before that run).

The Windows checkout was checked as well: its `outputs/models` already holds the verified bundle (same sha256 as `models/layer1`), with the old files archived in a subfolder, so it was never affected.

## 2026-10-01 · Phase 6: Interactive demo on bharathnaveen.com

**Goal.** Let a visitor paste a URL on the project page and see how the system reasons, and show the full system on real pages, including where it is wrong. Branch `phase6/demo` in both repos. How to rebuild: `demo/README.md`.

### What was built

- **"Try any URL", fully in the browser** (`demo/js/phishguard-engine.js`). A line-by-line port of URL canonicalization, the 54 Layer-1 features (including CPython's `urllib.parse` and `ipaddress` rules, tldextract's suffix matching and the BLAKE2s domain bucket), the shipped XGBoost model and its isotonic calibrator, the other three agreement models (Logistic Regression, LightGBM, Random Forest), the host identity check and the adjudication layer as it runs with no page capture. The URL is never fetched or sent anywhere; only the model files are downloaded, on first use.
- **Model export** (`demo/export_model.py`), hash-checked against `models/layer1/MANIFEST.json`: `model-core.json` (1.6 MB, 485 KB gzipped: scalers, XGBoost and LightGBM trees, calibrator, LR coefficients, the 6,950 ICANN public suffix rules tldextract loaded (sha256 `5e93da033c30...`), and Python's Unicode tables) and `model-rf.bin.gz` (1.07 MB: the 200-tree, 382,340-node Random Forest, loaded only when needed). No ONNX: plain tree arrays keep it small and let the JS make the same comparisons the libraries make.
- **Why the verdict needs all four models.** In ML-only mode the adjudication layer uses the 4-model vote (3 of 4 voting phishing adds evidence and can trigger the "high risk, missing evidence" rule), so a XGBoost-only demo could not reproduce the dashboard's verdict. With no capture every page-level input is constant (instrumented on 2,102 URLs: platform context `unknown`, hosting trust `unknown`, no HTML, behavior analysis unavailable), so the JS keeps only the URL-dependent terms. The parity test checks this reduction against the real dashboard, not against itself.
- **Top contributing signals** are XGBoost's own per-feature path contributions (`pred_contribs`, `approx_contribs=True`), recomputed in JS (largest difference from XGBoost 2.2e-6, from float32 vs float64 arithmetic).
- **Replay gallery** (`demo/build_gallery.py`): 8 test-split cases from the frozen snapshot replay (`metrics/results/tuning/test_after.json`): 2 brand pages called legitimate (Wells Fargo /about, Apple sign-in), 1 brand false alarm (Wells Fargo homepage), 1 sign-in page fixed by the tuning (Dropbox /home), 2 phishing caught (a Google Docs login clone on an unrelated domain, a Google sign-in clone on a bare IP), 2 missed (a clean-looking page on vercel.app, a page that showed the capture a "Just a moment..." bot check). Verdicts and signals come from the replay file, page titles from the snapshot (read only, nothing re-scored on the test split), the URL score from the shipped model. Phishing URLs are defanged and never links. The short explanation per case is hand-written from the recorded signals and labeled as such.
- **Honesty panel**, generated from `test_after.json`, `test_before.json` and `evaluation.json`: 4 of 136 brand sites flagged by the full system (7 before tuning; URL model alone 40.4%), 39 of 99 fresh phishing caught with 40 called legitimate (the known weakness), and 69 of 284 PhishStats URLs called phishing in ML-only mode with the other 215 uncertain.
- **Portfolio wiring** (`demo/install_portfolio.py`, idempotent): demo section first in `<main>` of `projects/phishing-detection-system.html`, a "Try it" button in that page's hero, and a "Try it" link on the homepage card.

### Parity: JS vs Python

The held-out test split was rebuilt with `phishguard train --full` in the cloud workspace; its file matches `evaluation.json` exactly (sha256 `a31c6c43efea...`, 147,714 rows; 147,702 are scored in VERIFIED_METRICS, see the note below). The reference is the app's own code with the shipped bundle (sha256 checked).

| Check | URLs | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 54 features identical | 148,746 (147,714 held-out + 1,032 curated and edge-case URLs) | 148,746 of 148,746 |
| Calibrated score, to the 6 decimals the app reports | 148,746 | 148,746 of 148,746 |
| Each model's vote (probability >= 0.5) and the 4-model consensus | 148,746 | 148,746 of 148,746 |
| Host identity class and confidence | 148,746 | 148,746 of 148,746 |
| Verdict of the real ML-only dashboard (`build_dashboard_analysis(reinforcement=False)`) | 21,032 (20,000 seeded held-out + all 1,032 others) | 21,032 of 21,032 (13,688 uncertain, 7,341 likely phishing, 3 app errors), and the same phishing, legitimacy and ambiguity signal lists on all 21,029 that have a verdict |

Largest probability differences (tolerance 1e-6): XGBoost 1.19e-7 (on 35 of 148,746 URLs), Logistic Regression 1.1e-15, Random Forest 3.3e-16, LightGBM 2.2e-16, calibrated score 0. The XGBoost difference is in the last bits of float32: XGBoost's compiled `exp` rounds differently from the browser's (checked on one URL: identical margin 1.327148, numpy's float32 exp reproduces XGBoost's result). On 1 URL this moved the model-spread number in the 6th decimal (0.103743 vs 0.103742), which has no effect on any verdict. Files: `demo/parity/results/parity_full_features_models.json`, `parity_dashboard_verdicts.json`. CI runs the same check on 1,332 URLs (`tests/test_demo_js_parity.py`, about 3 minutes; skipped if Node is missing).

### Found along the way

- **The dashboard crashes on some malformed URLs.** For inputs `urlsplit` rejects, such as `http://[1.2.3.4]/` or `http://[bad/`, `capture_signals._enrich_capture_and_html_signals` calls `urlparse` without a guard, so `build_dashboard_analysis` raises `ValueError` even in ML-only mode. The demo mirrors this ("no verdict: the Python app stops on this URL") rather than inventing a verdict. 3 of the 21,032 parity URLs hit it, all hand-written edge cases. Not fixed here (it changes app behavior); a one-line guard is a candidate follow-up.
- **30 rows lose their features in the training files.** 18 train and 12 test rows have empty feature columns in `kaggle_train.csv` / `kaggle_test.csv` (several are URLs ending in `//`, for example `www.sfbi.fr//`), and training drops them. That is the difference between the 147,714-row test file and the 147,702 rows in VERIFIED_METRICS. The app itself computes features for these URLs normally. Cause not investigated yet.
- **Public suffix list drift.** tldextract fetches the current list at run time, so the app's registered-domain parsing can change over time. The demo pins the list it was exported with (hash above).
- **Reproducibility, again.** The full retrain in the cloud workspace reproduced the split counts (600,761 / 147,714), the calibrator Brier scores (0.1408 raw, 0.1455 calibrated) and the test file hash exactly.

### Checks

- Pages at 390 px and 1280 px, light and dark: no horizontal scroll on the project page, no console errors, and no network request contains the URL typed into the box (Playwright, local server). Screenshots were shared in the chat.
- The homepage already scrolls sideways at 390 px (its hero is 453 px wide). That was already there before this change and is not touched here.

## 2026-10-02 · Phase 7: Figures drawn from the result files

**Goal.** Charts for the README and the website that cannot drift from the tables. Branch `phase7/figures`.

### What was built

- **`phishguard curves`** (`evaluation/curves.py`) re-scores the held-out test rows and writes `metrics/results/curves.json`: 201 ROC and precision-recall points per model, 10 calibration bins (raw and calibrated), a score histogram and the mean absolute XGBoost contribution of every feature. `evaluate` only kept summary numbers, so these could not be drawn before. The command refuses to write if any ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, Brier score or row count differs from `evaluation.json`.
- **`phishguard figures`** (`evaluation/figures.py`) draws ten charts as SVG, each in a light and a dark version, into `docs/figures/`, plus `docs/figures/README.md` with the plotted values as tables. It reads only JSON result files and needs only matplotlib. Running it twice gives byte-identical files.
- `metrics/reproduce.sh` now ends with both commands. Tests: 377 pass (4 new in `tests/test_figures.py`).

| Figure | Reads |
|---|---|
| `rebuild_before_after` | `metrics/audit_baseline/results/06_full_run.json`, `evaluation.json` |
| `layers_on_brand_sites`, `verdicts_by_set` | `evaluation.json`, `tuning/test_after.json` |
| `model_comparison`, `confusion_matrix`, `architecture` | `evaluation.json` |
| `roc_pr_curves`, `feature_contributions`, `calibration` | `curves.json` |
| `rule_tuning` | `tuning/{val,test}_{before,after}.json` |

### How curves.json was produced

The full run was retrained from scratch in the cloud workspace (`phishguard train --full`, seed 42). The Kaggle file (sha256 `330901bb4fbb...`), the train file (`c70ccdbc171e...`) and the test file (`a31c6c43efea...`) all match `evaluation.json`. The curves were scored with the shipped models in `models/layer1` (bundle sha256 `9758fb0f13fd...`).

### Found along the way

- **Logistic regression does not reproduce `evaluation.json` exactly.** XGBoost, LightGBM and Random Forest match to the last digit (difference 0.0), and so do both Brier scores. Logistic regression, both the shipped file and a fresh refit, gives ROC-AUC 0.7734 and PR-AUC 0.6971 against 0.7731 and 0.6958 in `evaluation.json`. It is a supporting model and the gap is in the third decimal, so the charts show the `evaluation.json` values and `docs/figures/README.md` states the difference. Open item: find out why (the earlier log entry measured a smaller gap) or re-run `phishguard evaluate` so the table matches the shipped file.
- **The model is overconfident at the top.** In the highest probability bin (28,798 test URLs, average score 0.97) 85% are phishing. This is the same weakness as the famous-homepage false alarms, now visible in the calibration chart.
- **Popular homepages.** 15 of 76 are called phishing by the full system, 8 of them pages that failed to load. The chart title was written to say brand sites are mostly cleared, not that false alarms are rare everywhere.
- **`path_length` dominates.** Its mean contribution (1.00 log-odds) is more than twice the next feature (`num_digits`, 0.42). The top 12 of 54 features carry 88% of the total.

## 2026-10-04 · Phase 8: Comparisons against something that already exists

**Goal.** Numbers that show the system next to an existing alternative on cost, time and simplicity, that anyone can regenerate on their own PC with no API key and no spend. Branch `phase8/baselines`.

### What was built

- **`phishguard baseline-llm`** (`evaluation/llm_baseline.py`). A free open-source LLM is the yardstick. It is asked once (`--record`, through Ollama on the local machine) and its raw answers are saved in `data/evaluation/frozen/llm_baseline_llama3_2_3b.jsonl.gz` (86 KB) with the model digest, Ollama version, prompt, options, hardware and data hashes. The default command replays that file offline and writes `metrics/results/llm_baseline.json`. Same pattern as the frozen live snapshot.
- **`phishguard cascade`** (`evaluation/cascade.py`). Arithmetic on saved scores: for ten band widths, what share of URLs Layer 1 settles alone, how often it is wrong on those, and the time per URL that follows from the measured latencies. `--rescore` rebuilds `metrics/results/heldout_scores.csv.gz` (label, raw and calibrated score for all 147,702 held-out rows, 584 KB) and stops if the Brier scores or row count differ from `evaluation.json`. With the LLM recording present it also reports the real end-to-end result of "Layer 1 first, LLM only for the unsure ones".
- Both render into `metrics/VERIFIED_METRICS.md`, both are in `metrics/reproduce.sh`, and the README has a "Compared with an existing tool" section. Tests: 385 pass (8 new in `tests/test_baselines.py`, two of which check that the committed result files are exactly what the committed inputs produce).

### Rules fixed before the recording

Seeded simple random sample of the held-out rows (seed 42, 2,000 URLs), one zero-shot prompt at temperature 0 that is not edited after seeing answers, answers that are neither "phishing" nor "legitimate" count as legitimate, Layer 1 judged at the app threshold. The LLM saw the canonical URL, cut at 500 characters.

### Results

Recording: llama3.2:3b (2.0 GB, digest `a80c4f17acd5`), Ollama 0.35.1, 2-core Intel Xeon @ 2.10GHz, CPU only, about 25 minutes. Layer 1 was timed in the same run on the same machine.

| Same 2,000 URLs (929 phishing) | Precision | Recall | F1 (95% CI) | False-positive rate | Time per URL p50 / p95 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Layer 1 | 0.752 | 0.860 | 0.802 (0.783 to 0.822) | 24.6% | 11.4 ms / 15.5 ms |
| llama3.2:3b zero-shot | 0.868 | 0.501 | 0.635 (0.606 to 0.664) | 6.6% | 742 ms / 1,447 ms |

F1 difference +0.167 (paired bootstrap 95% CI +0.134 to +0.202). The LLM took 65 times as long per URL. 8 of 2,000 answers were neither word.

Cascade on all 147,702 held-out rows: with an unsure band of 0.30 to 0.70, 19.9% of URLs go to the slow step and Layer 1 is wrong on 13.9% of the rest. End to end with the recorded LLM at that band: FPR 16.1% (from 24.6%), recall 0.770 (from 0.860), F1 0.787 (from 0.802), 81.6% of LLM calls avoided, 5.4 times faster than the LLM on everything.

### What the numbers taught us (honest notes)

- **The LLM is the more careful one.** It beats Layer 1 on precision and false alarms and loses badly on recall. "Layer 1 is better" is true for F1 and recall, not across the board.
- **The cascade does not raise F1.** Sending unsure URLs to this LLM trades recall for fewer false alarms. No band beats plain Layer 1 by more than 0.003 F1, and wide bands are worse. The defensible claim is speed and fewer false alarms.
- **Layer 1 is not clean even where it is sure.** With the widest band (0.05 to 0.95) it is still wrong on 9.9% of what it settles. This is the overconfidence already seen in the calibration chart, and it caps what any cascade built on this model can do.
- **This is one small model and one prompt.** Published work reports F1 near 0.88 for large hosted models zero-shot on a different, easier dataset. Nothing here measures those.
- **The time columns mix machines.** The cascade estimate uses Layer 1's 15.7 ms from `evaluation.json`, the LLM's 742 ms from this recording and the 6.8 s capture time from a GitHub runner. The LLM comparison itself is same-machine.

### Found along the way

- **The held-out file's hash differs in this workspace** (`360c30d2cc89...` against `a31c6c43efea...` in `evaluation.json`), with the same 147,714 rows, the same 147,702 scored rows and Brier scores identical to the last digit. tldextract here is 5.4.0 (5.3.2 in the published run) and it fetches the current public suffix list, the drift already noted in Phase 6. Not investigated further; pinning tldextract and its suffix list would remove it.
- A full-suite run needs no Ollama: the tests only replay.
